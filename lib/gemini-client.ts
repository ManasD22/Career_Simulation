Guidelines for course recommendations:
1. Include 2-4 courses per year based on career stage
2. Mix technical skills, soft skills, and certifications
3. Use real platforms: Coursera, Udemy, edX, LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, etc.
4. Include Indian institutions: IITs, IIMs, NPTEL, SWAYAM
5. Vary difficulty from Beginner to Advanced as career progresses
6. Include industry certifications (AWS, Google, Microsoft, etc.)
7. Add leadership and management courses in later years
8. Consider cost-effective options including free courses
9. Align courses with skills required for that year
10. Include emerging technology courses relevant to the field

Generate exactly 10 years of yearlyProjections with realistic course recommendations for each year.
